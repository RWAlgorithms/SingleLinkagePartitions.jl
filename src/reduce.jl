Terminology:
The partitions of two consecutive levels in any partition tree `pt` is such that the larger level corresponds to a larger partition that contains the partition that corresponds to the smaller level.
The part/cluster that merged as we traverse from level ``l`` to level ``l+1`` is the *merging distance* of the two levels.

`UseSLDistance` specifies the threshold merging distance of level `l` and `l+1`. For use with `picklevel(`.
